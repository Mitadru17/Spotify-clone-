# Spotify-clone-
HTML AND CSS using spotify clone This project is like a picture of Spotify, made with just HTML and CSS. It doesn't play music, but it looks like Spotify. I used colors, fonts, and layouts that look the same. Everything is organized neatly, and I used tricks with HTML and CSS to make it look right.
